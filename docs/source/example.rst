*CLARITE facilitates the quality control and analysis process for EWAS
of metabolic-related traits*

Data from NHANES was used in an EWAS analysis including utilizing the
provided survey weight information. The first two cycles of NHANES
(1999-2000 and 2001-2002) are assigned to a ‘discovery’ dataset and the
next two cycles (2003-2004 and 2005-2006) are assigned to a
‘replication’ datset.
